No Love Lost in the Garden of Eden
(Niklas Wallenborg,Webpage, 2023)

The web-page unfolds as a digital landscape, resembling a garden or forest populated by early internet GIF files 
associated with plant life and verdant symbolism. "No Love Lost in the Garden of Eden" stands as an exploration 
and tribute to the aesthetics of early internet culture, particularly the unsophisticated yet charming GIF animations 
that once proliferated online. Visitors are invited to meander through this digital terrain by simply scrolling through the webpage. 
( The GIFs are randomly placed on the web page )
